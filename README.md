Generate visualizations of GitHub user and repository statistics with GitHub
Actions. Visualizations can include data for both private repositories, and for
repositories you have contributed to, but do not own.

Generated images automatically switch between GitHub light theme and GitHub
dark theme.

## Background

This is a recreation of the same project created by [jstrieb](https://github.com/jstrieb) but written in GO.
I created this project to learn GO and make something with a known end goal. It behaves the same way as the original.
